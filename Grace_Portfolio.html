<p2> My idea of robotics have not change; I still think that robots are tangible programble machine that does a task once given a command. A robot is also a device that severs a purpose or role. What I am excited about the future of robotics is the way it can be useful in healthcare and humanitarian work. However, I am nervous of robotics taking over the world and causing people to be lazy. I do not want robots to replace people.
